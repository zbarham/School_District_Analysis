# School_District_Analysis: Analysis of School Data

In this analysis, I used Jupyter notebooks, pandas dataframes, and the os module to assess various data points of high schools in the provided new_full_student_data.csv file. The cleaned and analyzed data revealed some interesting insights into the student performance and school data correlations.

# Deliverable 6: Summarize Your Findings

Looking at the High School data I was able to look into student performance as a whole and how schools compare to the average and minimum scores found when analyzing the data. The biggest finding is that while charter schools have less funding overall compared to public schools the charter school math scores are higher in grades 9th through 11th than the public schools. I found out that while Dixon High School has the student with the lowest reading score it also is the third largest school by student count and overall has a strong reading score average in comparison to other schools in our data.
